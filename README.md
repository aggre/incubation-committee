# Incubation Committee

Dev Protocol Incubator is for OSS projects that are underfunded relative to their usage and mission.

Incubation Committee solicits OSS to be funded by open call, and all committee members vote to decide the staking as a grant. These processes are open to the public transparently through [this GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/dev-protocol/projects/7).
